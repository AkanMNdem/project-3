Unlike other customers I have some success getting my laptop (Asus) to connect with the Fire Stick. However after about 10 minutes of playback it will &#34;time out&#34; and stop playing through our TV even though Spotify on my computer still senses the Fire Stick. Then it won't play on either device until I restart the app on my tv.<br /><br />Especially frustrating since there's no reason the Fire app can't be a full-blown Spotify player rather than a receiver anyway.

I have owned many different types of school boards over the years but find that after I use them once they are ruined. I initially loved the ruler frame for this board but was blown away by the quality of it. The board itself is very sturdy. The chalkboard is easy to write on and the marker actually came off without leaving a shadow. I used the Arteza chalk markers and made sure to wipe off the chalk within 24 hours of writing on it. A wet rag and dry paper towel left the board looking brand new. This is definitely a school board that can last for many years. I would definitely recommend it.,Handmade,5.0,True,0,Handmade Products

Nice looking. Made well. It‚Äôs hard to put on by myself - near impossible - so I don‚Äôt take it off to shower.  It‚Äôs held up well with showering with it so it still looks nice.

"I really wanted to love these but they're unfortunately annoying to use. The problem is that they're made with two layers of fabric that are only attatched at the edges. Although the picture makes them look quilted, the lines are just decorative parts of the fabric itself.

If a dog is not sitting still, or anxious like mine, it may be easy to misread. If I bought again I would try a different color tag than silver. Otherwise this item is definitely worth buying.

"I love these! I ordered two cups, so I ordered two decals. They do require some care when applying. You need to follow the instructions precisely. You also need to take care when peeling off the backing and when peeling off the front carrier from the cup, but any letters that start to come up can be nudged back into position with your fingernail (be sure to peel slowly to watch for this), and smoothed back on easily. Once applied, the decal stays where it was put. They personalize my cups beautifully. I love the swirls!",Handmade,5.0,True,1,Handmade Products

When it came I was reminded how cheap silver looks.  All her other jewelry (rings, bracelets, piercings) are white gold or platinum.

"Received the ring yesterday and sadly the ring and the onyx are much smaller than expected and shown in the picture(s). If you have larger hands, like me (Size 12 - US) it looks a little too small and lacking.<br />Sizing is also a little off; compared to a ring that is the same size, it feels slightly smaller. Perhaps an size 11.5, but certainly not a 12.

"I actually love the gold coloring on this. Its the perfect yellow gold and the size is just right.  The hexagonal shape does emphasize how crooked your piercing may be, just a heads up.<br />But I do not understand why the hinge is at the bottom middle instead of where it should be near the portion that is near the piercing. It leaves a visible seam and it slightly bothers me. I plan to wear it in my septum for a while but will likely toss it in my ear where I don't think the seam will bother me.",Handmade,4.0,False,0,Handmade Products

"The joycons were working fine at first but as soon as we started to play multi player on the tv the controllers kept saying low battery, so we left them hooked onto the console and on the charging dock for a whole day and within 5 min the joycons continue to say low battery and turn off. I highly recommend buying the real joycons i learned my lesson.",Computers,1.0,True,0,Video Games

"I had to return this otherwise good product as soon as I saw how bright it was at night. My computer desk is six feet from my bed, and with blackout curtains, my bedroom is very dark‚Äîjust the way I like it to sleep. The blue LED lights on this unit are bright, waste electricity (granted, not much at all, but still), and cannot be turned off. And since the LEDs are recessed into the USB slots, the lights cannot be covered up without also covering up the ports themselves.",All Electronics,3.0,True,0,Video Games
"It is 80 percent for mobile gaming. 20 percent pc gaming. It's keys do not interact well for 9 of 13 games I play on pc. Also, you must have it plugged into pc to make it work at all which is disappointing.",All Electronics,3.0,True,9,Video Games
"I'm not much of a game fan - don't have an Xbox nor do I game using a PC. But this is fun! I use it mainly with the Wii Fit balance board attachment for exercise, and it provides a nice variation from the usual cardio machines or strength routines.<br /><br />Easy to set up and use. The graphics are not what you'd call top-notch, but are usable. All in all, I'm very pleased with it - never would have thought I'd own a game deck, but the Wii changed that!",Video Games,5.0,True,0,Video Games
"I think I would really like this game with my son, but opened the package from amazon and no game was in the box. It was shrink wrapped even.

These are good quality and light weight tripods.<br />Knowing their purpose is intended to be used for virtual reality but I'm actually going to use them for work lights.<br /><br />I believe they're going to be good for supporting a pair of lightweight work lights.<br /><br />They have infinite height control allowing me to find the perfect position for the work I'm doing.,All Electronics,5.0,False,0,Video Games
"I enjoy this game a lot.  It's like a major upgrade to the old duck hunt that everyone loved.  Even my wife who isn't a big fan of video games gets addicted to it.  It's the only game I own that she will ask out of the blue ""can we play?""  I think it's definitely worth buying.",Video Games,5.0,True,0,Video Games
