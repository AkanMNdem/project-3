I got so fed up with this in the last sequence that I just stuck with the mediocre ending instead of trying to get the good one. Overall though, it was an awesome game.",Video Games,4.0,False,3,Video Games,8.44482614170694e-05
"Lamnetably i order this product thinking this game is better than NBA live, but i was wrong.<br />The 2K10 Menu is a disaster and disorder.<br />I can't buy or exchanged players, al least i do not find the options to do it.<br />Anyway, i played the game once and in two months i ain't touch the game again.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Abdon Calderon",Video Games,1.0,True,0,Video Games,0.0016697394994991122
"My wife was jealous of my keyboard, so I got her a mechanical one as well. I didn't want to spend the money I spent on mine as she would not use many of it's features. I almost wish I had given her mine and gotten this for myself",Computers,5.0,True,0,Video Games,0.029346879039493512
"These are very cute and easy to put on. I just popped them inside out, then pushed them onto the joysticks. They do tend to end up tilted if I play for a long time, (meaning they rotate a little) but I don't really mind adjusting them when I'm done.",Video Games,5.0,True,0,Video Games,9.613652383055893e-05
I tried to like this game. I've played turn-based games before and this one is okay. Maybe I'm missing something but a tutorial or a display of stats would be helpful. Some things seem completely arbitrary - when my characters have traveled as far as they can or when certain troops should have won when they lost (or vice-versa.),Video Games,2.0,True,0,Video Games,0.00737693211804169
