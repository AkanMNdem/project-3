## Section 3: Results Reproduction Instructions
1. We first need to figure out what to dataset to analyze. For our group, we decided to analyze Amazon Product Reviews and gathered this data from a GitHub Repository.
2. We then decided how we are going to analyze this data, which we did on the basis of AI usage in reviews.
3. We searched for AI detection software, specifically ones where we had easy access (account creation is simple) to an API to send requests on the AI detection results.
4. After downloading the dataset for 3 different types of products, we graphically analyzed the character count of the reviews to create lower and upper bound on the character count per review.
5. We then cleaned the data to fit our data dictionary and pooled a random sample of 1000 reviews for each product set.
6. This random sample was sent to the Sappling AI detector using the Sappling AI detection API, but an even smaller sample from this was sent due to rate limiting by Sappling.
7. After gathering the data on AI detection, we ran a one-way ANOVA test, two sample t-test (comparing each group against another), and a chi-squared test to analyze statistical significance of AI usage between groups.
