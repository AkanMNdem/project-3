## Section 3: Results Reproduction Instructions
1. Run main.py: After downloading the dataset for 3 different types of products (Software, Handmade Products, and Video Games), graphically analyzes the character count of the reviews to create lower and upper bound on the character count per review. Settled on an upper bound of 600 characters. Visualizes using json and pandas
2. Run data_processing.py: this script cleans the data to fit data dictionary and pools a random sample of 1000 reviews for each product set.
3. Run ai_detection.py: this script sends a random sample to the Sappling AI detector using the Sappling AI detection API
4. Run analysis.py: after gathering the data on AI detection, this script runs a one-way ANOVA test, two sample t-test (comparing each group against another), and a chi-squared test to analyze statistical significance of AI usage between groups. Uses scipy and pandas for converting the data to a data frame then conducting statistical analysis. After that, visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn.
